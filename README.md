Story
-----
Once upon a time I was a young academician competing on my high school's quick recall team.  Tons of fun, made great friends, and learned a whole lot.  But being a data enthusiast, I was always disappointed with the lack of tools available to track my progress or see which areas I needed to improve on.  This project aims to answer those questions for coaches and players.  Hooray data!
